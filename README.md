# NGS Dashboard

## Project Description
NGS Dashboard is a web application that provides an intuitive interface for users to upload IonCode experiment results files or ZIP files. Once uploaded, the dashboard generates a comprehensive report detailing Amplicon Coverage, Base Depth, and Uniformity.

## Tech Stack
The project is built using the MERN stack with TypeScript. The report generation is accomplished using R Markdown. Here's a brief overview of the tech stack:

- MongoDB: A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.
- Express.js: A back end web application framework for Node.js.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- TypeScript: An open-source language which builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions.
- R Markdown: An authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R.

## Setup and Installation
To set up and install the NGS Dashboard on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <https://github.com/jonathan-githubofficial/ngs_dashboard>`.
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd ngs-dashboard`.
3. Install the dependencies:
   - For the server, navigate into the server directory (`cd server`) and run `npm install`.
   - For the client, navigate into the client directory (`cd client`) and run `npm install`.
4. Create a `.env` file in the server directory and fill it with your environment variables.
5. Start the server by running `npm run dev` in the server directory.
6. In a separate terminal, start the client by running `npm run dev -- --host` in the client directory.
